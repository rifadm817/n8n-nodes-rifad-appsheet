Welcome to **n8n-nodes-rifad-appsheet** – your friendly bridge between AppSheet and n8n!  
No more boring, hardcoded API calls. With our node, you can effortlessly manage your AppSheet table records by creating, reading, updating, deleting, or even invoking custom actions—all through an intuitive, no-code workflow automation tool.

## Features

- **Create Record:** Add one or more new records to an AppSheet table.
- **Read Records:** Retrieve records using a selector expression or by specifying key fields.
- **Update Record:** Update existing records by providing key fields and the new field values.
- **Delete Record:** Delete records by specifying key fields.
- **Invoke Action:** Invoke a custom AppSheet action on one or more rows.

## Install on n8n Cloud

If you use the cloud version of n8n (n8n.io), installing our node is a piece of cake. Follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Your n8n.io Account:**  
   Open your browser and log in at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io).

2. **Navigate to Settings:**  
   In the n8n editor, click your Profile → Settings icon.

3. **Go to Community Nodes:**  
   Select **Community Nodes** from the Settings menu. You’ll be able to search for and install custom nodes there.

4. **Search for `n8n-nodes-rifad-appsheet`:**  
   Type the package name in the search bar. When it appears, click **Install**.

5. **Add the AppSheet Node to Your Workflow:**  
   Once installed, add the AppSheet node to your workflow, configure it with your AppSheet API credentials, and start automating without hardcoding API calls.

## Usage

Simply configure the node with your AppSheet API credentials and choose an operation (create, read, update, delete, or invoke). Each operation requires you to provide the necessary parameters as JSON. For example, to add a record, supply a JSON array of objects (each object representing a record with the required key fields).


Happy Automating!
